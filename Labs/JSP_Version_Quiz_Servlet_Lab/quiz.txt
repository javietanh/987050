9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.
- check page scope for attribute called if found then use it else
- check request scope for attribute called if found then use it else
- check session scope for attribute called if found then use it else
- check application scope for attribute called if found then use it otherwise ignore the expression.

10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.
- first find the attribute in page, request, session, application scopes until attribute is found then:
- if first attribute is a bean then second attribute is a property of the bean
- if first attribute is a map then second attribute is a key of the map
- if first attribute is a list then second is an index of the list.

- servlet using request dispatch to forward the current request to the JSP page, all the data storage on the current request also dispatch to the JSP page.
- JSP also call servlet to the doPost & doGet service.
