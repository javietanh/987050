                                        TMNT!
                                        <br />
                                        This is not a bad movie!
                                        <br />
                                        You might say it has no storyline but I say it's kept simplistic for all the
                                        comic book fans. You don't want to confuse people with a massive complex tale.
                                        No one argues with 'Enter the Dragon' having a bad storyline!
                                        <br />
                                        The characters in this movie are wonderfully set up. Right from the start we see
                                        that Raphael has issues. This anger forces him to distance himself and in the
                                        process we feel his fury. We immerse ourselves in the character and see how deep
                                        he can go. From woefully staring into New York from a rooftop or letting out a
                                        frenzy upon the gang that has literally knocked April to the ground we are
                                        getting to know the character inside and out. This is the hero of the movie. As
                                        for the comedic cheek of Casey Jones or the light-hearted double wisecracks of
                                        Michaelangelo and Donatello, I'd love to see the reason behind this movie having
                                        "no character study" as some people might say.
                                        <br />
                                        The action scenes are set up within the constraints of a normal fun movie with
                                        great camera angles just dying to be put on an advert or poster.
                                        <br />
                                        The turtle effects by the Jim Henson creature shop don't disappoint even though
                                        Splinter looks like he walked straight off the set of 'Labyrinth'. The turtles
                                        are so good you shouldn't care anyway. The animatronics are fab and the voice
                                        characterisation is well chosen.
                                        <br />
                                        As for the main blessing, Steve Barron has chosen a dark tone for his movie. The
                                        original comic book would have been made proud by this attempt at making the
                                        movie more adult than people could believe. The crime-filled backdrops of New
                                        York make a great battleground, and the whole mythological element that all
                                        crime is ruled by a master ninja adds to the drama. The soundtrack couldn't be
                                        better for the beginning.
                                        <br />
                                        This is a fantastic movie and horribly underrated. With so many great elements
                                        this goes down as one of the all time great fantasy adventures. 10 out of 10 and
                                        a cowabunga to boot!</q>

                                        remembers the phenomenon that swept the country during the late 80's and early
                                        90's. And this movie proves what was once a big icon fad that was the Teenage
                                        Mutant Ninja Turtles. This movie is well made for a kids movie, and it is my
                                        favorite of the series of films. I even like this more than the TV show. It has
                                        more drama and action than the other parts. And it's dark, I like that in a kids
